Worked in Open Source for the past 15 years doing engineering leadership and on multiple iterations

Umbraco and a succesful exit, some would say I eventually succeeded. 

Currently at Zalando in Berlin, leading a 3 teams of security professionals making fashion shopping
a secure and privacy-respecting.
